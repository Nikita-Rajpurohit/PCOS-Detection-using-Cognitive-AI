# PCOS-Detection-using-Cognitive-AI

This project aims to detect Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using machine learning techniques. PCOS is a common hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age.Early diagnosis can significantly improve quality of life and help in managing long-term health effects.

## Problem Statement

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is often underdiagnosed due to its complex symptoms and lack of awareness. This project utilizes clinical data to train machine learning models for accurate and efficient detection of PCOS.

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - PCOS Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).
- Contains clinical and medical features such as age, BMI, blood work results, and ultrasound outcomes.

## Models Used

The following models were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluation metrics include:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Curve

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - scikit-learn  
  - seaborn  
  - matplotlib  
  - imbalanced-learn

## Key Steps

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Selection & Engineering  
4. Model Training and Evaluation  
5. Result Interpretation & Visualizations

## Results

- Best-performing model: **Random Forest**
- Achieved high accuracy and recall in detecting PCOS, demonstrating the potential of ML-assisted diagnosis.

## Visualizations

- Correlation heatmaps  
- Feature importance graphs  
- ROC-AUC curves for model comparison
